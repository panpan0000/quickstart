### 6. How to cancel a tcloud job?
- You can use `tcloud cancel -j [JOBID]` command.

### 9. Why does my job submission process take a long time?
- We will retrieve the dependencies section in your tuxic.conf file. If the dependencies are different from the last time, tcloud will do more process. In order to save time, please confirm the required dependencies as soon as possible.
